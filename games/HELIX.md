# HELIX Project

The HELIX Project is a reimagining of traditional hearing tests, leveraging the power of virtual reality to assess a player's hearing capabilities. HELIX features a rhythm game that acts as a pure tone test to determine a player's hearing thresholds at a variety of frequencies, as well as an escape room experience that simulates a digits-in-noise test to assess the player's speech perception when dealing with competing background noise.

As my first delve into the Games for Health sector of game development, I was honored to work under the management of industry veteran Jeff Fisher. I learned a multitude of valuable skills that elevated my capabilities in Unity to a professional level. I also had the opportunity to work with audiologists and health care providers to ensure that HELIX met their standards and delivered accurate results.

- Assessed and procured Unity assets to accelerate development
- Used top-of-the-line audiometers to calibrate audio files
- Performed data analytics and visualization
- Created editor tools
- Developed unit tests
- Implemented Unity-specific Git workflows
- Worked with a focus group to refine user experience

The HELIX project proved to be an interesting design challenge. Not only did we have to make the controls intuitive for a wide variety of potential patients, but we had to carefully add player feedback to guide them without tampering the test results, which was an iterative process. In order to make the test practical in a clinical setting, we also had to make the experience completely automated and possible to complete within a restricted time window. 

HELIX has just completed it's first phase of trials, and we're eager to release more information soon.
