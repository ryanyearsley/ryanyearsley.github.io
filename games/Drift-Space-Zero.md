# Drift Space Zero  

{% include youtube.html id="gUc-AgZ5AaM" %}

Drift Space Zero is a true zero-gravity racing game with a unique mix of retro car culture and mind-bending fractal art where players race through a complex tunnel system as it materializes in front of them. Inspired by the niche genre of 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) games such as Descent and Elite Dangerous, players are given full control over their spacecraft in six directions: forward and backward, up and down, left and right, as well as rotation around these axes. The fastest pilots in Drift Space Zero are able to combine these thrusting forces to drift their spaceship diagonally through the stage in order to achieve victory.

Drift Space Zero is a project I created outside of the classroom with my friend and colleague, Ben Cutler. Now, it serves as a great showcase of the tools we learned at Wilmington University's game design program, including visual effects and 3D modelling in AutoDesk Maya. We showcased DSZ at several video game conventions and submitted a video for participation in Stugan summer camp. and served as our debut into the world of game development.

My contributions to the project include:

- Rigidbody physics vehicle controller
- Track generation system
- Game design
- 3D models (spaceships, environment)
<br>

The core design of Drift Space Zero is simple in nature, but presents a remarkably high skill ceiling. The modular nature of the tunnel system allowed for the order to be shuffled at the beginning of every race, keeping players in suspense as they improvised their way through a new layout with every attempt.
